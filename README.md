# AptoMed: Empowering Patients with Secure, Blockchain-Powered Health Records

AptoMed is a web application designed to enhance patient empowerment through secure, blockchain-powered health records. Using the Aptos blockchain, AptoMed allows users to store and manage their healthcare data securely.

## Key Features

1. Fetch Patient Records
   - Input Field: Enter the Patient ID to retrieve records associated with that ID.
   - Button: Clicking Fetch Records will initiate the process to gather the patient's medical history from the blockchain.

2. Add Patient Record
   - Diagnosis Input: Enter the patient's diagnosis.
   - Treatment Input: Specify the treatment prescribed to the patient.
   - Button: Clicking Add Record will submit this information, which will be securely stored on the blockchain.

3. Patient Records Display
   - After adding or fetching records, the application displays a list of patient records.
   - Each record shows relevant details, such as:
     - Record ID
     - Diagnosis
     - Treatment
     - Timestamp (when the record was created or updated)
